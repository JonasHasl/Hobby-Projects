The Economy Score is based on financial indicators adjusted for look-ahead bias such that all values are known to the financial markets when the score is calculated.
The score is made based on a maximizer function of either sortino or sharpe ratio or a combination of these. The economy is ranked by the scores of the given indicators at a given point in time.
Thus, the indicators are ranked and compared to values of other points in a time period since the year 2000. Combining all the indicator scores, a combined rank is given which
is normalized to a score between 0 and 100.

The predictions for next months return are based on the same indicators as above using a neural network with several hidden layers. On each layer a dropout rate of 0.4 has been used to avoid 
overfitting. An EarlyStopping function has also been used to make the model stop when there has been no improvements in the validation loss for a given amount of epochs. This is also 
a measure to avoid overfitting.

-Data is adjusted for look-ahead bias
-Data is detrended and adjusted where it seemed fit to make the series stationary.
-Autocorrelation has not yet been accounted for
